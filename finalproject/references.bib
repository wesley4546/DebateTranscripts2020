  abstract = {Data mining has been widely applied in various domains; however, there have been limited studies into discovering hidden knowledge from factual data about selected groups of people with special characteristics. It is important to mine data about such group of individuals to extract insightful knowledge that could lead to a better understanding of their personalities, in addition to further sociological conclusions. This paper presents the application and outcome of data mining techniques, namely data clustering and association rules extraction, to find common features and relations among social, environmental and socioeconomic factors from the lives of known influential individuals in history. The mining process was initiated by constructing a dataset through defining, extracting, and retrieving important known facts about these individuals from selected and reliable sources. Second, association rules discovery algorithms were applied in order to show interesting patterns and highlight relations between attributes. Finally, the data were clustered into different groups and each cluster was further analyzed to identify its most strongly defining attributes. The extracted association rules showed how some factors are related, such as the effect of environment type and order of birth in the family on the age at which the individual first engaged with their domain of influence. The clustering exercise demonstrated that influential people who grew up in families of a similar size and financial status share many similar characteristics.},

  abstract = {It is estimated that more than 80 percent of today's data is stored in unstructured form (e.g., text, audio, image, video); and much of it is expressed in rich and ambiguous natural language. Traditionally, the analysis of natural language has prompted the use of qualitative data analysis approaches, such as manual coding. Yet, the size of text data sets obtained from the Internet makes manual analysis virtually impossible. In this tutorial, we discuss the challenges encountered when applying automated text-mining techniques in information systems research. In particular, we showcase the use of probabilistic topic modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation, an unsupervised text mining technique, in combination with a LASSO multinomial logistic regression to explain user satisfaction with an IT artifact by automatically analyzing more than 12,000 online customer reviews. For fellow information systems researchers, this tutorial provides some guidance for conducting text mining studies on their own and for evaluating the quality of others.},

While exact computation of this probability is intractable, several estimators for this probability have been used in the topic modeling literature, including the harmonic mean method and empirical likelihood method. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that commonly-used methods are unlikely to accurately estimate the probability of heldout documents, and propose two alternative methods that are both accurate and efficient.},

  abstract = {Latent variable models have the potential to add value to large document collections by discovering interpretable, low-dimensional subspaces. In order for people to use such models, however, they must trust them. Unfortunately, typical dimensionality reduction methods for text, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, often produce low-dimensional subspaces (topics) that are obviously flawed to human domain experts. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) An analysis of the ways in which topics can be flawed; (2) an automated evaluation metric for identifying such topics that does not rely on human annotators or reference collections outside the training data; (3) a novel statistical topic model based on this metric that significantly improves topic quality in a large-scale document collection from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).},
